				What is CouchBug?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					CouchBug is a native iOS application for CouchSurfing, meaning all it's content have been designed for viewing on your iPhone &amp; iPod Touch device. You don't need to move the page sideways like regular website. 
				</p>
				<p>
					CouchBug currently supports only small subset of features available on CouchSurfing website, but we plan to implement more features over time. Our idea is to make it like an election. Write features you would like to see in next release on our Twitter and Facebook page and the most popular ones will be implemented sooner.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				So what features are currently implemented?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>Login with CS username</li>
					<li>Profile overview (# of unread messages, CouchRequests, friend requests)</li>
					<li>Full-featured CouchSearch</li>
					<li>Nearby couches by GPS location</li>
					<li>User's profiles with personal information, location, couch information and references</li>
					<li>Option to send CouchRequests</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Why was CouchBug created and by who? 
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					We are two CouchSurfers from Europe and we have been traveling around the world for a while. We know from our own experience, that carrying and using laptop while traveling can be quite uncomfortable sometimes. It's usually big, heavy, fragile, expensive and the battery doesn't last very long. We like to travel lightweight and we carry our iPhones with us at all times. But using CouchSurfing website on the small screen doesn't feel very good. So we decided to create CouchBug. We think mobile devices are the future and in case of traveling, it makes even more sense. 
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>
				Why CouchBug costs money if CouchSurfing is free?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					We are not currently affiliated with CouchSurfing Inc. other than being active members of the network. We develop this application in our own time and it took us more than 3  months to get to this point. So we decided to charge a small price per download so we have money for food and transportation and we can continue developing it while traveling. We are currently unemployed and working at just random freelancing projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, CouchSurfing posted an ad about hiring it's own mobile developers for iPhone and Android devices. We see this as an opportunity for CouchBug to became official CouchSurfing app and thus FREE. So we applied for this job. You can support our effort by using our app and/or recommend it to your friends and/or writing to CouchSurfing staff about it. It would be great honor for us to work with CouchSurfing directly.

				Is there way how can I help you guys?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Yes, we are looking for translators to different languages, graphic designers and other programers to join the two of us. Please contact us on Facebook or Twitter and we will tell you how to help us. Also you can "Like" us on Facebook and leave us a nice review in the AppStore! That will motivate us to add new features as soon as possible.
