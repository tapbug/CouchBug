			What is CouchSurfing?
		</h2>
		<p>
			CouchSurfing is an international non-profit network that connects travelers with locals in over 230 countries and territories around the world. Since 2004, members have been using our system to come together for cultural exchange, friendship, and learning experiences. Today, over a million people who might otherwise never meet are able to share hospitality and cultural understanding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our mission as an organization is to create inspiring experiences: cross-cultural encounters that are fun, engaging, and illuminating. These experiences take many forms. CouchSurfing's initial focus was on hosting and "surfing" (staying with a local as a guest in their home). Alongside these core experiences, we now also facilitate a growing array of activities and events.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have a vision of a world where everyone can explore and create meaningful connections with the people and places they encounter. Each CouchSurfing experience shared by our members brings us closer to that vision.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How does CouchSurfing work?
		</h2>
		<p>
			CouchSurfing members share hospitality with one another. These exchanges are a uniquely rich form of cultural interaction. Hosts have the opportunity to meet people from all over the world without leaving home. "Surfers," or travelers, are able to participate in the local life of the places they visit. We also give more people the chance to become travelers, because "surfing" lowers the financial cost of exploration.
		</p>
		<p>
			The CouchSurfing community continues to expand its horizons. Members are always finding more ways to connect and learn about each other. Every day, people across the world share coffee, camping trips, meetings, language exchanges, discussions and all sorts of other experiences.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How is CouchSurfing run as a non-profit organization?
		</h2>
		<p>
			CouchSurfing is a non-profit organization, funded entirely by the generous donations of our members and run according to our guiding principles -- one of which states that being a non-profit is essential to our mission. Every month, thousands of CouchSurfers choose to support the community by getting verified, an identity check that includes a donation. Other members choose to make independent or additional donations. Each positive experience between members costs just 24Â¢ USD in CouchSurfing operating costs, so even small donations have a big impact towards helping us achieve our mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			Achieving our charitable mission requires gathering and spending resources, but we do so with the understanding that CouchSurfing's non-profit status legally mandates that all resources must be spent directly on achieving the mission rather than creating profit for private interests. The goal of CouchSurfing has never been about money, and using the site is free to all members. It's all about helping to reach our vision of a better world.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Who runs CouchSurfing?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The effort that goes into supporting the CouchSurfing community is done by people all over the world -- many contributing as volunteers from home, along with a smaller long-term staff.
		</p>
		<p>
			Casey Fenton launched the site in beta on Jan 1, 2003 with the help of co-founders Dan Hoffer, Sebastien LeTuan, and Leonardo Bassani de Silveira. Casey continues to help CouchSurfing pursue its vision as Executive Director of the organization.

Since 2004, over 1.7 million successful CouchSurfing stays have been recorded, over 1.9 million new friendships have been formed through CS, and over 120,000 of those are described as being close friendships. Members have reported over 4.3 million positive experiences, which is an incredible 99.7 percent of all CS experiences.
