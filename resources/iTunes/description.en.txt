CouchSurfing is an international non-profit network that connects travelers with locals in over 230 countries around the world. Since 2004, members have been using CS system to come together for cultural exchange, friendship and learning experiences. Today, CouchSurfing has more than 3 million members.

We are CouchSurfers too and we know that you don't always have your laptop with you on your travels. That's why we decided to create CouchBug. An easy, beautiful and fast way to access CS on the go. 

We implemented basic features so far, but we are committed to work really hard on this app and bring you more features soon.
